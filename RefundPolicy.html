<h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>

<p>
This cancellation and refund policy outlines how you can cancel an order or seek a refund for a product or service purchased through the Platform.
</p>

<p>
Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made <b>before the order is prepared</b>. However, cancellation requests may not be entertained if the order has already been communicated to the seller/merchant listed on the Platform and the preparation process has started. In such cases, cancellation will not be allowed.
</p>

<p>
The Platform does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items such as food and beverages once the order is prepared. However, a refund or replacement may be considered if the user establishes that the quality of the food delivered was not satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
In case of receipt of damaged, spilled, or incorrect food items, please report the issue to our customer service team on the <b>same day of delivery</b>. The request will be reviewed after verification by the seller/merchant.
</p>

<p>
If you feel that the food item received is not as shown on the Platform or does not meet your expectations, you must notify customer support <b>within the same day</b> of receiving the order. The customer service team will review the complaint and take an appropriate decision.
</p>

<p>
In case of any refunds approved by <b>RGM College Canteen App</b>, the refund will be processed within <b>5–7 business days</b> to the original payment method.
